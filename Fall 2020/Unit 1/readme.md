# Unit 1: Responsive Media Instruments
### Outcome:
        What is a Realtime Media Instrument?  Continuously nuanced gestural response vs discrete “if-then” logic.   
        Examples (e.g.  Adriene M and Claire B, David Rokeby, Chunky Move)
### Exercise:
        -Using provided standalone Max applications, write-up a description of the experience created using the supplied, default media. 
        -Describe the qualities of both the unmodified input, and the processed output. 
        -Find new media to replace what was supplied with the assignment.
        -Describe the qualities of the replacement media, and the new processed output.
        -Describe what is qualitatively different in the original media and the processed outputs.
        -Explain in your own words how the processed output was changed.
### Supplied Application(s):
        -Single application
        -Should be parameter wise fairly simple. (e.g. only modifiable parameters being the input media.)
        -Takes both audio and video as input.
        -Output effects can be spectacular, while also being legible as to how the input media played a role.
        -Video could come from the “Toy Effect” List in SC
        -Audio could be manipulated by sc.delaysequencer~
        -Minimalist UI window on Standalone.
        -Max Source Options + Media:
