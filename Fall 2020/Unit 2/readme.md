# Unit 2: Video Instruments
### Outcome:
    Media curating part 1. What types of video are best suited for different applications & techniques? 
### Exercise:
    - Students are provided with 3 different video processing apps and 4 - 6 different video samples
    - Video samples from cameras, film, games, and television.
    - Should contain a mix of jump cutting, stable backgrounds, b&w vs. color, saturation and exposure levels
    - Students should try out each video sample with each video app.
    - Students then describe in 1-2 paragraphs per application which samples worked best and worst as input.
    - Include qualitative rationale as to why a sample is ranked a certain way.

### Given Application(s):
    - 3 applications
        - presence / background subtraction which highlights foreground
        - Motion / edge-detection
        - Recolor / color-mapping
    - require as minimal computer spec as possible to run.
    - Similar to week 1, should function largely as black boxes with minimal surface UI
