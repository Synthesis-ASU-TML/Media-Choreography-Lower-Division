### Unit Description
Unit 1 is designed as the foot wetting section.  Ideally the applications supplied with this portion of the learning course help to motivate students to dive deeper into the material. To accomplish this aim, the linked software suite is designed with minimal modifiable parameters to avoid intimidation while still producing compelling media outputs.
