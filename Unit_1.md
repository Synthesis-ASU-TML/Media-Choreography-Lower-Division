## Unit 1

### Unit Description
Unit 1 is designed as the foot wetting section.  Ideally the applications supplied with this portion of the learning course help to motivate students to dive deeper into the material. To accomplish this aim, the linked software suite is designed with minimal modifiable parameters to avoid intimidation while still producing compelling media outputs.

### Application List

#### Audio Applications
- **Droney**
    - Software that takes two audio files as input, then plays random grains (or short sections) of each file slowly to create a facsimilie of an ambient audio drone.
    - The playback rate is incredibly slow (between 5% & 15% normal speed), which both smoothes many staccato dynamics in the audio and shifts almost all sounds to the lower frequency range.
    - Users that only have access to built-in laptop speakers or low fidelity headphones may not be able to experience much of the application output due to the lack of bass tone capabilities of these speakers / headphones.
- **Bleep Sequencer**
   - Software that takes an audio file as input, then uses the dynamics in the track to create "bleeps".
   - Users can experiement with the audio detection methods used to trigger bleeps and mixing the original audio with the bleep output audio.
   
#### Video Applications
- **Contours**
    - Takes a video file as input and attempts to re-render each frame as if they were contour elevation maps.
- **Hue Shadow**
    - Takes two video files as input and replaces the hue of one video with the hue of the second video.
    - Each video is recomputed using the Hue-Saturation-Luminance colorspace instead of the traditional Red-Green-Blue colorspace.
        - Hue: The base color tone
        - Saturation: The richness of the color tone. Vibrant colors have full saturation values, greyscale images have low saturation values
        - Luminance: The brightness of the image.
    - Meant to give a window into exploring how visual media gets structure and context from a wide variety of parameters.
- **Cell Noise**
    - Takes a video file as input and re-renders each frame using [Voronoi (or cellular) noise](https://thebookofshaders.com/12/) patterns.
    - Meant to give the option to explore structured methods of distoriting images.
