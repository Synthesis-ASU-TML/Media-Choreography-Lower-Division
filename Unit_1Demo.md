### Cell Noise
An introductory application to give experience with using noise (or psuedo-randomness) to create effects. Attempts to create a painterly effect using generated cells that decide their color based on the original video frames.

### Hue Shadow
An introductory application to give experience with the structure of video data. Takes the saturation and luminance of one video and replaces the hue with the hue component of a different video. Aims to show students how images as we perceive them digitally are structured and rely on more than just colors to convey their content.

### Droney
An introductory application to give experience with how changes in aspects such as playback speed can have profound effects on the output of a piece of audio data. Takes in two audio files, chops them into small pieces (or grains) and then plays them back at verying, slow speeds.


### Bleep Sequencer
An introductory application to give experience with basic types of audio filtering and analysis. The app takes in an audio file and filters it based on the mode chosen by the user. The filtered audio is then fed to onset analysis (a module that looks for new notes, like hitting keys on a piano) to find the points when to produce a bleep. The bleeps are in the central pitch of the current audio sample and is resonated as long as is set by the user. Users can mix the original audio with the bleep track audio to create a new glitchy song.
