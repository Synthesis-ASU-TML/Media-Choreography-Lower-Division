## Unit 2 - Video Applications & Media

### Description
This unit is designed to give students access to different kinds of visual effects while also experimenting with how these effects perform on videos with various types of content. The effects from this unit are based on simplified computer vision and color modification. 

### Application List

- **Vector Fields**
    - Computer Vision
    - Computes motion analysis of each video frame using the Horne-Schunk flow algorithm and draws the output with feathers (directional vector lines). Users can change the feather resolution and scale along with a colored outline of the underlying video input.
- **Stutter Frame Differencing**
    - Computer Vision
    - Computes the difference in neigboring frames and only draws the differences to the output window. The "stutter" is the time delta between individual frame samples
- **Colored Edges**
    - Computer Vision
    - For each frame of the input video, the application computes an estimation of edges between subjects in the video and only draws the estimated edges. These transitions are drawn with the color located at the detected edge point.
- **Recolorer**
    - Color Modification
    - For each frame of the input video, the application re-renders the colors with an alternate palette selected by the user. 
- **Hue Shifter**
    - Color Modification
    - An application that demonstrates a method to quickly and smoothly modify the color of an image or video by using the Hue-Saturation-Luminance and changing the hue value by a set amount for the whole image.
