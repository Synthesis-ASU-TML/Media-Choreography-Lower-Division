## Unit 3 - Audio Applications & Media

### Description
This unit is designed to give students access to different kinds of audio effects while also experimenting with how these effects perform on audio files with various types of content. The effects from this unit are based on simplified methods for creating soundscapes, using simulated reverberation, delays, and banks of filters.

### Application List

- **Simple Soundscape**
    - Using up to four different audio files, users can modify playback speed, pitch, and volume to create a Soundscape.
- **Granular Playback**
    - Functions similarly to Simple Soundscape, but uses grains (small snippets) for playback rather than the entire audio track.
    - Gives users the freedom to create evolving, dynamic soundscapes by changing the grain configuration during playback.
- **Simple Reverb**
    - An introduction to using reverberation in audio processing. Takes up to four different audio tracks.
- **Delay Sequences**
    - An application in which users can experiment with delaying, pitch shifting, and mixing an audio track.
- **Simple FFFB**
    - An introduction to using banks of filters to modify a single audio track.
