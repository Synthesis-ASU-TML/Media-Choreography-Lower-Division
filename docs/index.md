## Media Choreography Instruments

### Project Goals

- Create a series of applications built from Max/MSP/Jitter to enable students and collaborators to use some of the same realtime media manipulation techniques as are available to Synthesis @ ASU.
- Provide software for teaching students and others interested in how to create "Media Environments" entry level tools to experiement with effects and media without the need to code them directly.
